## Completing A Program - Chapter 7 of Programming: Principles of programming using c++ book
## Includes code examples, test, drills and chapter exercises for Chapter 7
## Executable files can only be run in a unix system ('.out' extension)
## All executable files compiled using -Wextra -Wall -pedantic flags


## Guide to the chapter 7 exercise questions and where to find each solution

* [Exercise 1](./exercise01cal.cpp): Allow underscores in the calculator's variable names [exe file](./cal01).

* [Exercise 2](./exercise02cal.cpp): Provide assignment operator =, so that you can change the value of the variable after introducing it using let. [exe file](./cal02).

* [Exerccise 2 discussion](./exercise02discussion.txt): Discuss why changing the value of the variable can be useful and how it can be a source of problems.

* [Exercise 3](./exercise03cal.cpp): Provide named constant that really can't change the value of. [exe file](./cal03).

* [Exercise 4](./exercise04cal.cpp): Rewrite the calculator to use a variable of type Symbol_table. [exe file](./cal04).

* [Exercise 5](./exercise05cal.cpp): Modify Token_stream::get() to return Token(print) when it sees a newine . [exe file](./cal05).

* [Exercise 6](./exercise06cal.cpp): Have the calculator print out some instructions for how to use the calculator if the user presses the H key (both upper- and lowercase) [exe file](./cal06).

* [Exercise 7](./exercise07cal.cpp): Change the Q and h commands to be quit and help, respectively. [exe file](./cal07).

* [Exercise 8](./exercise08cal.cpp): Fix the grammar comment to define the sequences of statement, such as 4+4; 5+6;, also add whatever you feel is needed to that comment as the first comment of the calculator program and its over-all comments. [exe file](./cal08).

* [Exercise 9](./exercise09cal.cpp): Suggest three improvements (not mentioned in this chapter) to the calculator. Implement one of them [exe file](./cal09).

* [Exercise 10](./exercise10cal.cpp): Modify the calculator to operate on ints (only), give errors for overflow and underflow. [exe file](./cal10).

* [Exercise 11a](./exercise11a.cpp): FIRST - Revisit two programs you wrote for the exercises in chapter 4 or 5. Clean up that code according to the rules outlined in this chapter . See if you find any bugs in the process [exe file](./cal11a).

* [Exercise 11b](./exercise11b.cpp): SECOND - Revisit two programs you wrote for the exercises in chapter 4 or 5. Clean up that code according to the rules outlined in this chapter . See if you find any bugs in the process [exe file](./cal11b).
