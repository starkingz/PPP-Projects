1.      Name four major types of errors and briefly define each one.
Ans:    * Runtime-error: This is an error that throws an exception while the system is running.
        * Compiletime_error: This is an error that is found by the compiler.
        * linker error: This is an error that occures when the object file can not link to the executable file.
        * Logic error: This is a programmer error, it is made by the programmer when you give the computer wrong logic

2.      What kinds of errors can we ignore in student programs?
        * Errors that can not be fixed

3.      What guarantees should every completed project offer?
        * Every completed project should be free of errors
        * Every completed should always check for errors catch if necessary

4.      List three approaches we can take to eliminate errors in programs and
        produce acceptable software
        * Check for error from callee function
        * check for error in function calling
        * catch exceptions

5.      Why do we hate debugging?
        * we hate debugging because its tedious

6.      What is a syntax error? Give five examples.
        * syntax error is an error that is found when you write the wrong pattern of a statement or code
        *       1. for (initialized var; conditional statement; increment) { //... body ...// }
        *       2. return type identifier(parameter list)
        *       3. return type identifier(parameter list');
        *       4. int val = area('0);
        *       5. int val = area("f");

7.      What is a type error? Give five examples.
        * Type errors throw an error when you store the wrong value in the wrong data type
        *       1. int i = "4";
        *       2. char c = 2;
        *       3. int a = arena(4); // mispelled function name (arena not declared)
        *       4. int b = area("two", 2) // expected two int arguments (wrong input in first argument)
        *       5. int c = area(4)      // wrong number of arguments

8.      What is a linker error? Give three examples.
        * It throws an error message when object file can not be combined with executable file
          or a function can not be linked to its libraries
        *       1. #include <iostraem> // library not found
        *       2. int a = area(9, 9)  // area not declared in this scope
        *       3.  #include "main.hhh" // main.hhh does not exist

9.      What is a logic error? Give three examples
        * This is when your code does not output your expectations or desired result(its likely you wrote the wrong code)
        *       1. double val = 9 / 2 * 2; cout << val << endl; // Expectations: 9, prints 8 instead of 9
        *       2. int i = 0; while (i <= 10) cout << i; // Expectations: Range of 0 through 10. Result: prints Overflow (infinite loop)
        *       3. short int shnum = 2000000000000000000 * 2000000000000000; cout << shnum;

10.     List four potential sources of program errors discussed in the text.
        * Incomplete program
        * Logic errors
        * Poor specifications
        * Unexpected argument or input
