# Drill 1

## Problem:
Create three files: my.h, my.cpp, and use.cpp. The header file my.h contains
       ```
       extern int foo;
       void print_foo();
       void print(int);
       ```
The source code file my.cpp #includes my.h and std_lib_facilities.h, defines
print_foo() to print the value of foo using cout, and print(int i) to
print the value of i using cout.
The source code file use.cpp #includes my.h, defines main() to
set the value of foo to 7 and print it using print_foo(), and to print the
value of 99 using print(). Note that use.cpp does not #include std_lib_
facilities.h as it doesnâ€™t directly use any of those facilities.
Get these files compiled and run. On Windows, you need to have
both use.cpp and my.cpp in a project and use { char cc; cin>>cc; } in use.
cpp to be able to see your output. Hint: You need to #include <iostream>
to use cin.

## Solution:
Header file: [my.h](./my.h)
Main file: [use.cpp](./use.cpp)
