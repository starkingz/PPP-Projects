1.	What is the purpose of working on the program after the first version works? Give a list of reasons
Ans.	*    To improve code readability
	*    To work seriously on error handling
	*    Improving user interface
	*    Adding useful and cool features
	*    Restructuring code for ease of understanding and modification

2.	Why does 1+2; q typed into the calculator not quit after it receives an error
Ans.	*  After the program receives an error it calls keep_window_open()
	   ... function from std_lib_facilities.h library to keep the window alive
	   ... and ask user for an input to quit the program

3.	Why did we choose to make a constant character called number?
Ans.	Well that choice was made because we want to avoid 'magic constants' and
	... avoid over commenting(using comments to remind ourselves that '8' is a
	... number that manipulates Token) and using '8' was hard to remember
