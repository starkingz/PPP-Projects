1.	What is the purpose of working on the program after the first version works? Give a list of reasons
Ans.	*    To improve code readability
	*    To work seriously on error handling
	*    Improving user interface
	*    Adding useful and cool features
	*    Restructuring code for ease of understanding and modification

2.	Why does 1+2; q typed into the calculator not quit after it receives an error
Ans.	*  After the program receives an error it calls keep_window_open()
	   ... function from std_lib_facilities.h library to keep the window alive
	   ... and ask user for an input to quit the program

3.	Why did we choose to make a constant character called number?
Ans.	Well that choice was made because we want to avoid 'magic constants' and
	... avoid over commenting(using comments to remind ourselves that '8' is a
	... number that manipulates Token) and using '8' was hard to remember

4.	We split main() into two seperate functions. What does the new function ...
	... do and why did we split main()?
Ans.	*   The new function calculate() deals with the calculation (expression) loop
	*   Well we split main() because it performs two seperate logical tasks

5. 	Why do we split code into multiple functions? State principles.
Ans.	* Makes it easier to spot errors
	* Makes the code logically seperate
	* Ease testing
	* Makes the functions re-usable
	* It improves the readability of the code and program in its entirety
	* It helps the code maintainer in identifying the uses of the code.....
	......through its function name
	* It structures the code in a unique manner
	* It gives you an area to focus and help you understand the code.....
	......properly without distraction (it saves you from unecessary distraction).
	* It makes code easier to maintain
