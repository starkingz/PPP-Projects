1.      What is the difference between a declaration and a definition?
Ans.    * Declaration gives the basic informations for a statement while a definition gives the full informations.
        * A declaration can be defined more than once while a definition can not.
        * All definitions is a declaration but only some declarations is a definition.
        * A decleration is an interface while a definition is an implementation of the interface.
        * Definition consumes memory whereas declaratoin don't..

2.	How do we syntactically distinguish between a function declaration and
	a function definition?
Ans.	* Syntactically a function declaration consists of a return type, an
	identifier, an argument/parameter list if necessary
	and a closing semi-colon. e.g void age(int a);
	while a function definition consists of a return type, an identifier, an
	argument/parameter list if necessary and a body which is delimited by
	curly braces. e.g void age(int a){/*.....*/}
