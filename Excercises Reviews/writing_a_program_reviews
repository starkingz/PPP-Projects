1.      What do we mean by “Programming is understanding”?
Ans.    Programming is understanding becuase you need to basically understand the requirements to write a computer program or implement code

2.      The chapter details the creation of a calculator program. Write a short
        analysis of what the calculator should be able to do.
Ans.    The calculator would handle only + - * / and would be read as an expression

3.      How do you break a problem up into smaller manageable parts?
Ans.    Using pseudo code

4.      Why is creating a small, limited version of a program a good idea?
Ans.    To avoid feature creep and it helps buiding a program less tedious and make you feel less overwhelmed

5.      Why is feature creep a bad idea?
Ans.    Feature creep is a bad idea because it makes it tedious and makes the original idea of a program seem    useless

6.      What are the three main phases of software development?
Ans.    Analysis, design and implementation

7.      What is a “use case”?
Ans.    This is a way a system can be used to anchieve a task

8.      What is the purpose of testing?
Ans.    Testing is used to check if the requirements/specifications of a program are all met

9.      According to the outline in the chapter, describe the difference between a
        Term, an Expression, a Number, and a Primary.
Ans.    a. Terms handles only multiplication, division and modulo operators and it is first calculated before an expression
        b. An expression calcualates only addition and subtraction Numbers, and it binds less tighter than term
        c. Number reads a floating point value
        d. Primary handles an expression in a bracket before it handles any other operations

10.     In the chapter, an input was broken down into its component Terms, Expressions,
        Primarys, and Numbers. Do this for (17+4)/(5–1).
Ans.    (21)/(4) = 21 / 4 = 5.25

11.     Why does the program not have a function called number()?
Ans.    Thats because we already have floating point types as an external function

12.     What is a token?
Ans.    Token is a sequence of characters that reads characters and a number

13.     What is a grammar? A grammar rule?
Ans.    A grammar lets us transform a program into a syntax tree
        Grammar rule is a rule that reads a stream of tokens and search through the tokens to find a match

14.     What is a class? What do we use classes for?
Ans.    A class is a user defined data type that groups data and functionalities
        ........ A class is used to group data and functions and it is also used to create an object

15.     How can we provide a default value for a member of a class?
Ans.    using initializer list

16.     In the expression function, why is the default for the switch-statement to “put back” the token?
Ans.    That is because we need to store Token in input stream so they can be used in main function to know if the user wants to print or quit the program

17.     What is “look-ahead”?
Ans.    To foresee into the expression

18.     What does putback() do and why is it useful?
Ans.    Putback() puts a value that has already been read by cin back into istream... So it can be read by another variable using cin
        putback() is useful when trying to determine if a value is a number or word then it brings back the value that has already been read by char so it can be read again by a double or a string if necessary.

19.     Why is the remainder (modulus) operation, %, difficult to implement in the term()?
Ans.    modulus operator is difficult to implement because we need to determine the input given is an integer and not a floating point number.
